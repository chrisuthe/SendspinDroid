<b>How It Works</b>

SendSpin Player connects to a SendSpin server over WebSocket to receive audio streams with precise timestamps. A Kalman filter synchronizes the device clock with the server, and audio is played back at the exact correct time using sample-level sync correction. This enables multiple Android devices (and other SendSpin clients) to play the same music in perfect sync.

<b>Requirements</b>

A SendSpin server or Music Assistant instance on your local network (or accessible via WebRTC for remote connections).
