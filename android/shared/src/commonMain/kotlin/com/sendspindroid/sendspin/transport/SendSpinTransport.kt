/**
 * Transport abstraction for SendSpin communication.
 *
 * This interface allows SendSpinClient to work with different transport mechanisms:
 * - **Local**: Direct WebSocket connection to server on local network
 * - **Remote**: WebRTC DataChannel via signaling server for internet access
 *
 * Both transports carry the same SendSpin protocol (JSON text + binary audio),
 * but differ in how the connection is established and maintained.
 *
 * ## Transport Lifecycle
 * ```
 * [Created] -> connect() -> [Connecting] -> [Connected] -> close() -> [Closed]
 *                              |              |
 *                           [Failed]     [Disconnected]
 * ```
